Using map functions as database views
———————————
Within my NoSql database, views are created by creating map and reduce javascript functions to retrieve and extract necessary data.

HTML, CSS, JS is served directly from NoSQL and the NoSQl database controls the ability to read and write from the database.


Retrieving data
———————————
Data is entered by importing meta data as items are created in the database. This data is used to update document info and is available via a json data feed.


Creating Documents with JSON
————————————————

By connecting to an existing web application, NoSQL can act as a cache layer from a SQL database to retain certain content.
